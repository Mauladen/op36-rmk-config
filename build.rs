//! This build script copies the `memory.x` file from the crate root into
//! a directory where the linker can always find it at build time.
//! For many projects this is optional, as the linker always searches the
//! project root directory -- wherever `Cargo.toml` is. However, if you
//! are using a workspace or have a more complicated build setup, this
//! build script becomes required. Additionally, by requesting that
//! Cargo re-run the build script whenever `memory.x` is changed,
//! updating `memory.x` ensures a rebuild of the application with the
//! new memory settings.
//!
//! The build script also sets the linker flags to tell it which link script to use.
//!
//! Vial is disabled (`vial_enabled = false` in keyboard.toml), so no vial
//! config is generated here.
//!
//! The `memory.x` is the RP2040 layout: 2M flash with the 256-byte second-stage
//! bootloader at `0x10000000` (the blob itself comes from `embassy-rp`) and 256K
//! SRAM at `0x20000000`.
